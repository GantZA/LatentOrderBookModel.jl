# Acknowledgements

We would like to thank Byron Jacobs and Chris Angstman for their work in deriving the SPDE,  its numerical solution and related code patterns. We would also like to thank Donovan Platt for his research into calibrating the latent order book model and the code patterns for the numerical solution and calibration techniques. Michael Gant would like to thank Tim Gebbie for his supervision of this paper which entailed numerous discussions, valuable advice and resources
